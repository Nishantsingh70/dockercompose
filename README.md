# dockercompose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1)Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2)Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3)Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app.
